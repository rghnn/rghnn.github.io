### Social Project
#### Minority in ML
I proudly identify as a cisgender woman and a member of the ace community. Although it was a journey, I've come to embrace this intersectionality despite its many challenges and lonely moments. Fortunately, I was fortunate enough to find supportive individuals who helped me through tough times. However, I recognize that not everyone has access to the same level of support. This is why my life's mission is to help those who come after me. If you're hosting a workshop for women and queer individuals in science, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'd love to offer my support and contribute to the success of your event.<\br>

As an attempt to empower younger generation who are facing similar challenges, I have decided to start "minority in ML project". The follwoing is from my [twitter post](https://twitter.com/_ghnn_/status/1481716036508467201?s=20). Please contribute if you can:<br/>
"They say artists create the art they wish it existed."
I am no artist but for a while I wish to see stories from minority groups in ML all gathered in one place. Why? Data! I wish for people and myself to read them see where are we going wrong. How can we grow and get better? How can we build more inclusive communities. I wish for younger kids having a hard time seeing "this hardship whatever it is shall pass". I had this social project in mind for a while. I finally got the courage to start it come here and ask for your stories!
If you see yourself as a minority in ML I ask you to please write your stories and send them to the email I opened for this reason:
minorityinml@gmail.com . I am aiming to get about 20 stories. Put all of them together, make them a longer version and publish it or make it a long personal blog post. Depending on how the story teller feels i will give them credit or keep them anonymous.
Please specify if you want to remain anonymous. In exchange for each story I recieve (until I reach 20 stories) I will donate small amount to a charity.
