# Rozhina Ghanavi

I am a scientist, machine learning researcher, and cyclist.<br/> 
I have broad science interets, Maths, statistics, biology, and recently social sciences. I have done research works in generative models, natural language processing (NLP), MCMC and sampling methods, reinforcement learning. In another life I was working on next generation of telecommunication approaches (5G at the time). <br/>
Right now do machine Learning research at [Cohere](https://cohere.ai/) where I train large representational language models.<br/> 
I am a cyclist at UTRR (university of Toronto road racing). In another world I was a track cyclist! <br/> 
I got my Masters from the University of Toronto in 2021 where I was advised by Professor [Ben Liang](https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~liang/). I did research under supervision of [Alireza Makhzani](http://www.alireza.ai/) at [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).
