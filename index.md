# Rozhina Ghanavi


- I am a scientist! A quantitative one, I like to use machine learning tools to understand the world or vice versa!<br/> 
- I have broad science interests and have spent some time exploring them. Now, I am passionate about quantitative marketing, the economics of AI, and using machine learning, maths, and statistics tools to solve problems in social sciences. <br/>
- My most recent research focuses on the Economics of AI and how to use Machine Learning models for better goods for humans. I work with brilliant professors and researchers like [Avi Goldfarb](https://discover.research.utoronto.ca/7532-avi-goldfarb) and [Ryan Webb](http://ryan-webb.com/). <br/>
- I have done research works in generative models, natural language processing (NLP), MCMC and sampling methods, and reinforcement learning. In another life, I was working on the next generation of telecommunication approaches (5G at the time). <br/>
- I am interested in impactful research and projects. <br/>
- If you have similar interests and have a project that I can help with or collaborate on, do not hesitate to contact me via email or DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_ghnn_). (rozhina dot ghanavi at rotman dot utoronto dot ca). <br/>
- Not all of my research works are published, but the few of them that are published can be found here at my [scholar page](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=zbrHCycAAAAJ&hl=en)<br/>
- I am a researcher at [TDMDAL](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/FacultyAndResearch/EducationCentres/TDMDAL), Finhub, and [Rotman school of Management](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/).
- I spent some time at [Cohere](https://cohere.ai/) as a machine learning researcher, where I trained large representational language models.<br/> 
- I got my Masters from the University of Toronto in 2021, where I was advised by Professor [Ben Liang](https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~liang/). I did research under supervision of [Alireza Makhzani](http://www.alireza.ai/) at [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/).<br/>
- I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Tehran. I was advised by amazing [Maryam Sabbaghian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fCts8c0AAAAJ&hl=en).
- I did an internship at Carleton University, and I was privileged to work with [Halim Yanikomeroglu](https://www.sce.carleton.ca/faculty/yanikomeroglu.html)
